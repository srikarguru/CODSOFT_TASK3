Password Generator:
This is a simple password generator script that allows we to generate strong and secure passwords for your accounts. It takes user input for the username and desired password length and then generates a random password for we.

How to Use:
1.Enter Username: When prompted, enter the username for which we need to generate the password. This can be your username on a website, application, or any other account.
2.Enter Password Length: Next, enter the desired password length. You can specify the number of characters we want in your password.
3.Generate Password: Once we've provided the username and password length, the script will generate a random password for we using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.
4.Accept or Reset: The generated password will be displayed on the screen. If we are satisfied with the password, we can accept it and use it for your account. If we are not happy with the generated password, we can choose to reset and generate another password.

Why Use a Password Generator?
Using strong and unique passwords is crucial for the security of your online accounts. Many security breaches happen because of weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack. A password generator helps we create complex passwords that are difficult to predict, thus enhancing the security of your accounts.
Security Considerations
This script runs locally on your device, and no data is sent or stored anywhere else.
The password generated is random and not stored anywhere, so it's essential to save the password securely after generating it.
